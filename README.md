# Rapid Math Tricks And Tips Practice
Unofficial simple web app for practicing the tricks and tips taught in Edward H. Julius' book "Rapid Math Tricks And Tips".
You can build it yourself from source or you can try it out here: https://djmclaugh.com/RapidMathTricksAndTipsPractice/

## How to build
`npm install` (only need to run once after you clone the repository)

`npm run-script build` (run after `npm install` and every time you want your changes to take effect)

This will generate the `bundle.js` file in the `app` directory.

Once `app/bundle.js` is generated, simply open `app/index.html` with your favorite browser.
